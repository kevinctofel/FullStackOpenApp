# FullStackOpenApp
A React app to track progress in the FullStackOpen course

## What it should do

- Using React, a NodeJS server and a database, the app should show a list of all parts and sub-parts of the FullStackOpen course
- Each part should be a toggle item to expand and show all sub-parts
- Each item should have a checkbox or other indicator to show completion
- Each item could also have a text field to enter a URL for any online notes for that part
- Eventually, this could be a multi user app

## Why do it

- Put our learning into practice
- Create something useful
